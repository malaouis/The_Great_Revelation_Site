    <h2>Chapter Excerpt</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Evil came first. The world was already corrupt when God spoke of placing a khalīfah. Good was the divine response, not the starting point.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Contrary to common religious doctrine, this chapter begins with a shocking truth hidden in plain sight: that evil preceded good in the Quranic worldview. The angels’ question in 2:30 reveals a world already tainted by corruption and bloodshed — before the creation of Al-Insān. This insight reframes the role of Iblis, not as a villainous figure, but as part of a metaphysical design — a necessary antagonist in the human journey toward spiritual maturity.

    <h2>Key Insight</h2>
    <p>
      The soul of man is a battlefield. Within each Insān lives a dual Nafs — one that commands evil (*nafs ammārah*) and one that reproaches and reflects (*nafs lawwāmah*). This internal conflict is not a flaw but a design — the very structure that allows for growth, repentance, and ascension. Drawing from Quranic psychology and metaphysical logic, this chapter shows that evil is not the opposite of good — it is the condition through which good is chosen and realized.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      وَمَا أُبَرِّئُ نَفْسِي ۚ إِنَّ ٱلنَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌۢ بِٱلسُّوٓءِ  
      <br>
      “And I do not acquit my own soul, for the soul is indeed a persistent enjoiner of evil.” (Quran 12:53)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Read the Full Chapter</h2>
    <p>
      The full chapter explores the roots of evil, the cosmic role of Iblis, and the structure of the human psyche — revealing that the path to light passes through darkness. This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding divine justice and the cycle of spiritual refinement explored in later chapters.
