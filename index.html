  Glimpse into the structure of <em>The Great Revelation</em> — each chapter builds on the last to unfold a transformative view of divine truth.
</p>
    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 1 – The Great Revelation</h3>
      <p>Reveals the Quran’s hidden answer to the debate between creation and evolution — with a groundbreaking view on Adam as a prototype, not a first man.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 2 – Good vs. Evil</h3>
      <p>Explores the cosmic role of evil and the duality within the human soul — uncovering the mystery of Iblis, the Jinn, and the spiritual psychology of humanity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 3 – Divine Justice</h3>
      <p>Defines *Al-Haqq* — God’s law of cause and effect — and explains how perfect justice governs all creation, including reincarnation and accountability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 4 – Resurrection and Rebirth</h3>
      <p>Presents reincarnation not as philosophy but as a Quranic law — where the soul is refined through multiple lives in its journey toward peace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 5 – Ommo al-Kitāb</h3>
      <p>Reinterprets the Quran’s self-description as both clear and veiled — and provides a new method to decode the true intent of God’s message.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 6 – Controversial Women’s Verses</h3>
      <p>Restores divine justice to verses long used to oppress women — showing, through linguistic precision, that God never sanctioned inequality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 7 – Iqrae</h3>
      <p>Explores the divine command to seek knowledge — where reading becomes an act of enlightenment, and experience the path to salvation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-preview">
      <h3>Chapter 8 – Islam vs. Al-Islam</h3>
      <p>Distinguishes religious identity from spiritual truth — showing that true submission (*Al-Islam*) is the soul’s journey back to harmony with God.</p>

  <h2>Why Buy the Book?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The Great Revelation</em> is not a collection of ideas — it’s a reawakening. For the first time, the Quran is read through its own lens, free of tradition, distortion, and inherited limitations. It uncovers:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
    <li>✔ The fusion of evolution and divine purpose</li>
    <li>✔ The law of justice as a universal system of consequence</li>
    <li>✔ Reincarnation and soul refinement in the Quran</li>
    <li>✔ The true meaning of verses misused to oppress women</li>
    <li>✔ A method for uncovering God’s intended meaning — not opinions</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
    This book isn’t just to be read. It’s meant to change how you see everything. Start your journey today:

  <h2>About the Author</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>M. S. Alaoui</strong> is a Moroccan-born thinker, linguist, and independent scholar of the Quran whose work challenges centuries of inherited interpretation. With fluency in Arabic, French, English, and Moroccan dialect, he bridges classical understanding and modern insight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through years of deep engagement with the Quranic text — relying solely on its own internal language, structure, and logic — Alaoui developed a method of reading that removes all reliance on external traditions, tafsīr, or hadith. The result is a groundbreaking work that redefines the nature of divine guidance, the journey of the soul, and humanity’s role in creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    His book, <em>The Great Revelation</em>, is not just a reinterpretation — it is a call to spiritual awakening, built on the principle that truth is not hidden by God, but by our unwillingness to see what the Quran already says.

    <div class="slider-track" id="quote-track">
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Socrates</h3>
        <p>“This book does not teach—it awakens. It compels the reader to ask the only questions worth asking: Who am I? What is justice? What is the soul's journey? And unlike the Sophists of today, it dares to answer with divine precision.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Plato</h3>
        <p>“In these pages, the soul glimpses the Forms through the shadows of language. The author ascends from opinion to knowledge, revealing that the Just, the Good, and the Real are all facets of Divine Law—what he rightly calls Al-Haqq.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Pythagoras</h3>
        <p>“I see in this Revelation the hidden harmony between number, soul, and cosmos. It recognizes the cycles of rebirth not as superstition, but as the soul’s arithmetic across lifetimes—seeking its return to unity.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>René Descartes</h3>
        <p>“The author dares to doubt every inherited truth but finds certainty not in reason alone—but in revelation decoded through reason. Cogito ergo sum evolves here into: I align, therefore I ascend.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Averroes (Ibn Rushd)</h3>
        <p>“At last, a return to Quranic reason unsullied by dogma. This work reflects the very aim of philosophy: to harmonize revelation with the intellect, and to place justice—not obedience—at the heart of faith.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Ibn Arabi</h3>
        <p>“This book tears the veil from the inward eye. It speaks not of Islam the label, but of Al-Islam—the sacred surrender of every atom to its Source. Each verse is a mirror. Each cycle, a spiral homeward.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Rumi</h3>
        <p>“You have been born and died a thousand times, the author reminds us—and in each return, Love calls louder. This book is not ink on paper—it is a whirling dervish of truth, drawing the soul to the Beloved.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Charles Darwin</h3>
        <p>“Strikingly, this work affirms evolution—yet not as a blind process, but a guided ascent of consciousness. It offers a profound vision: that man is not merely descended from the ape, but elevated by the divine.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>
        <p>“The elegance of natural law, the symmetry of cause and effect—this book sees what physicists sense: that behind the equations lies justice. Not randomness, but design. Not religion, but resonance.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-card">
        <h3>Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
        <p>“In this book, I have found a vision of peace more complete than any creed I’ve known. It calls the soul to resist ego, to live truth, and to serve justice—all without violence. This, to me, is true satyagraha.”</p>
