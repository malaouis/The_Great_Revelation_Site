    <h2>Chapter Excerpt</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “You were dead, and He brought you to life. Then He will cause you to die, and bring you to life again — and to Him you will return.” (Quran 2:28)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we confront the neglected truth that the Quran speaks of life, death, and return — in the plural. Rebirth and resurrection are not one-time events, but a **cyclical process**. Each soul is refined across lives, given chances to learn, reflect, and return to God — not by force, but by earning readiness through understanding and justice.

    <h2>Key Insight</h2>
    <p>
      This chapter explores the divine mechanism behind spiritual growth: a cycle of births and deaths through which the soul evolves. Drawing from Quranic language — such as *nashʾah*, *khalq*, and *baʿth* — it demonstrates that resurrection is not merely eschatological, but experiential. True resurrection is awakening — and it happens many times before the soul returns to its source.

    <blockquote>
      كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَٰتًۭا فَأَحْيَٰكُمْ ۖ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ  
      <br>
      “How can you disbelieve in God, seeing that you were dead and He brought you to life, then He will cause you to die, then bring you to life again, then to Him you will return?” (Quran 2:28)

    <h2>Read the Full Chapter</h2>
    <p>
      This chapter unveils the forgotten cycle of divine justice. Through it, you’ll see how reincarnation restores the balance that one life cannot explain — and how awakening to this truth frees the soul from repeating the cycle in vain.
