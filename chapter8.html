    <h2>Chapter Excerpt</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Al-Islam is not an identity. It is the peaceful equilibrium the soul reaches after perfecting reason, enacting justice, and aligning with divine law.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This chapter redefines the concept of Islam. It is not the name of a religion — it is the **destination of the soul**. Al-Islam is not inherited; it is earned through a life of spiritual striving, where the soul sheds ego, balances its dual self, and becomes one with divine harmony. Religion, law, ritual — all are means, not ends. The end is inner peace — not stillness, but perfected alignment with Al-Haqq.

    <h2>Key Insight</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the Quran, God describes those who achieve peace not by the label “Muslim,” but by their state: *sālim*, *mutmaʾinnah*, *muqarrab*. Al-Islam is not submission under compulsion — it is the conscious, enlightened pacification of the soul. This chapter shows how the journey from Bashar to Insān to Muslim to Muqarrab is a path open to all — and the only true way to peace on Earth.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      يَـٰٓأَيَّتُهَا ٱلنَّفْسُ ٱلْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ  
      ٱرْجِعِىٓ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةًۭ مَّرْضِيَّةًۭ  
      <br>
      “O soul at peace, return to your Lord — pleased and pleasing.” (Quran 89:27–28)

    <h2>Read the Final Chapter</h2>
    <p>
      This chapter completes the journey of *The Great Revelation*. It is the call to humanity: to transcend form and return to essence. To awaken from ritual and rise into awareness. To build peace — not by conquering others, but by transforming the self.
