    <h2>Chapter Excerpt</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Iqraʾ does not mean recite. It means seek. It means awaken. It means: engage with reality until light breaks through.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we revisit the very first word revealed to the Prophet Muhammad: *Iqraʾ*. Far from a call to ritual recitation, this is a divine imperative to engage with the world, to question, to witness, and to internalize meaning. The Pen is not a tool of tradition — it is a symbol of inner recording, of perception and memory, of a mind processing divine truth through lived experience.

    <h2>Key Insight</h2>
    <p>
      The command *Iqraʾ* is linked to creation itself — it is the mode through which the soul fulfills its divine trust. The Pen, referenced in Sūrat al-ʿAlaq and Sūrat al-Qalam, represents the inner capacity to absorb reality and extract meaning. Knowledge is not transferred — it is awakened. Enlightenment is the result of experience filtered through the self, aligned with justice and truth.
    </p>

    <h2>Read the Full Chapter</h2>
    <p>
      This chapter reveals the heart of the human journey: from ignorance to illumination. It redefines reading as an act of divine self-realization — and shows how every experience is a verse, every insight a sign, and every life an unfolding revelation.
