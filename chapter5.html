    <h2>Chapter Excerpt</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “The Quran does not contain unclear verses. It contains truth — and what resembles truth. To separate the two, one must seek the Mother of the Book.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we challenge centuries of Islamic tradition based on a critical misreading of Quran 3:7. Rather than dividing the Quran into clear (*muhkam*) and unclear (*mutashābih*) verses, this chapter shows that *all* verses are divinely designed — but some reveal the intended meaning (*Ommo al-Kitāb*), while others resemble it in form. The key to decoding them lies not in scholarly training or hadith — but in the Quran’s own linguistic and grammatical structure.

    <h2>Key Insight</h2>
    <p>
      The Quran is not to be explained — it is to be uncovered. This chapter presents the foundational method for doing so: isolating the *intent* embedded in God’s own words by rejecting foreign sources and following the divine logic of language. Through a revised reading of 3:7, we learn that the *mutashābih* is not ambiguous — it’s strategic. It invites the heart to seek alignment with the *Mother of the Book* — the intended, singular truth.

      هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ مِنْهُ ءَايَـٰتٌۭ مُّحْكَمَـٰتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ

      “He is the One who revealed the Book to you: some of its verses are perfected — they are the Mother of the Book — while others resemble them…” (Quran 3:7)

    <p>
      This chapter presents the method by which all the later findings of *The Great Revelation* were uncovered. It is not an interpretation — it is an unveiling. The entire structure of God’s message is decoded from within the Quran itself. Learn how to trace divine intent, and distinguish it from resemblance.
